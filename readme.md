# üìÉ ruby-twitter-bot

this is a capstone project from microverse.

on this project i build a bot in ruby, using twitter's api. it was created with the intent of storing the location originated from the found tweet so i could quantize what part of the globe was more active on the search topic.
with this bot one can: 
- search for topics;
- display results while searching;
- auto like found tweets;
- create new tweet informing the bot found it;
- save to local storage using yml;
- retrieve from local storage;
- display the top 10 locations from found tweets.



## üì° technologies used

- ruby
- twitter api
- yml
- github

ruby, twitter api, yml and github was used on this project.



## üöÄ the project

this project can be found in https://github.com/firmoholanda/ruby-twitter-bot



## üî® instructions

the instructions are as follows to download and run this bot:

download:

1. clone the source repository from Github.

  on the command line, enter:
  git clone https://github.com/firmoholanda/ruby-twitter-bot.git 

  or you can use Github for Windows or Github for Mac instead of the command line. go to: https://github.com/firmoholanda/ruby-twitter-bot, and click on the "Clone or download" green button.

2. extract files to the desired location;

3. cd (change directory) to extracted directory;

4. give execute permission to the twitter_bot.rb
``` 
chmod +x bin/twitter_bot.rb
```


installation:

1. create a twitter api account;

  to start using the Twitter api, you need to [register your application with Twitter](https://apps.twitter.com/). registration requires you to answer some questions about your application and agree to the [Twitter api terms of use](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/agreement-and-policy).
  your new application will be assigned a consumer key/secret pair that identifies your application to Twitter.

2. insert your api keys and secret;

change lines 23, 24, 25 and 26 on the bin/twitter_bot.rb file, with your information:
  ```
  @@api_config = {
      consumer_key:        "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY",
      consumer_secret:     "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET",
      access_token:        "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
      access_token_secret: "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"
  }
  ```

3. install dependencies;

```
gem install twitter
```


usage:

- after that, you can start the bot by running 

``` 
ruby ./bin/examples.rb
```

it will initialize the application, look for tweets related to ruby coding, display information on the terminal, like the found tweet and create a new tweet informing what was found. then, it will display the top 10 locations sorted in ascending order and then save that information on a yml file called: stored_tweets.yml

like_the_tweet, alert_in_new_tweet

```
my_bot = TwitterBot.new
my_bot.find_tweets([["ruby", "rayls", "coding"], true, true, true)
my_bot.display_top_10_locations	
my_bot.save_stored_tweets	
```

you can also use:
```
my_bot.retrieve_stored_tweets	
my_bot.display_stored_tweets
```
to load information from stored_tweets.yml to the class and then display on the terminal.
